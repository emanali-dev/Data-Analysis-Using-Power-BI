# Data-Analysis-Using-Power-BI
This project showcases a comprehensive data analysis and visualization workflow using Power BI on a Supermart sales dataset with 10 million rows.
The dataset was originally provided during the DataViz Competition organized by the FAST Data Science Society at NaSCon’25. Although our team couldn’t finish the challenge on time, I took it as a personal goal to complete the analysis and build an insightful dashboard.

🚀 Project Highlights
🔄 Data Cleaning:
Handled missing values and structured the dataset for analysis.
Optimized for efficient processing in Power BI with large datasets.
📐 DAX Formulas:
Built custom measures to calculate revenue trends, top-selling products, and regional performance.
📊 Interactive Dashboard:
Designed and implemented a Power BI dashboard to visualize:
Sales breakdowns (by category, region, product)
Order frequency and customer trends
Revenue performance over time
🏆 Context
This analysis was inspired by the DataViz Competition, where participants were challenged to clean, analyze, and visualize massive datasets under tight deadlines.
